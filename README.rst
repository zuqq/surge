surge
=====

Surge is a client for the BitTorrent network, built on top of Python's
coroutine-based concurrency model and the asyncio event loop. Please note that
it is download-only for now.

Installation
------------

Surge requires Python 3.8 and `docopt`_. The recommended way of installing these
dependencies is to use `poetry`_. Run

.. code-block::

    poetry install

in the root folder, which automatically gathers the dependencies from the
provided ``pyproject.toml``.

.. _docopt: https://pypi.org/project/docopt/
.. _poetry: https://python-poetry.org/

Usage
-----

Surge has a minimal command-line interface for downloading a single torrent,
located in the ``__main__`` module. Inside of a ``poetry shell`` or another
appropriate environment it can be run as ``python -m surge``.

**Example:**

.. code-block::

    $ python -m surge --file debian.torrent
    Reading metadata from debian.torrent.
    Progress: 1340/1340 pieces.

**Help page:**

.. code-block::

    $ python -m surge --help
    Download files from the BitTorrent network.

    Usage:
        __main__.py (-h |Â --help)
        __main__.py [--folder FOLDER] [--resume] [--log LOG]
                    [--peers PEERS] [--requests REQUESTS]
                    (--file FILE | --magnet MAGNET)

    Options:
        -h, --help          Show this screen.
        --folder FOLDER     Destination folder
        --resume            Resume the download.
        --log LOG           Log file.
        --peers PEERS       Maximal number of peers [default: 50].
        --requests REQUEST  Maximal number of requests [default: 50].
        --file PATH         Torrent file.
        --magnet MAGNET     Magnet link.

Architecture

Protocol extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Surge supports the following extensions to the `BitTorrent protocol`_:

- `Metadata file exchange`_
- `Tracker list`_
- `UDP tracker protocol`_
- `Compact tracker response`_

.. _`Tracker list`: http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0012.html
.. _`UDP tracker protocol`: http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0015.html
.. _`Compact tracker response`: http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0023.html

Features
~~~~~~~~

Concurrency:
    Surge is designed to connect to many peers at the same time.

Availability tracking:
    Surge keeps track of which pieces its peers have, enabling it to make
    successful requests.

Endgame mode:
    Surge requests the last few pieces from every available peer, so that
    a handful of slow peers cannot stall the download.

Incremental writes:
    Surge writes pieces to the file system immediately after downloading and
    verifing them, keeping its memory usage low.

Request queuing:
    Surge uses request pipelining, improving network throughput.

Actor model
~~~~~~~~~~~

Peers are modeled as actors; the strong encapsulation provided by this model
makes it easy to deal with unresponsive or malicious peers.

For details about the implementation of the actor model, see the documentation
of the ``actor`` module.

Protocol implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The protocol is implemented in the spirit of `Sans I/O`_, meaning that its
state machine is completely independent from any objects performing I/O;
this enables convenient mock-free unit testing.

The state machine is based on generators functions, which provide a natural way
to express multiphasic protocols.
